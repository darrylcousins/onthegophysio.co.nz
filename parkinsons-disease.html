  <h2>Parkinson's Disease</h2>

<p class="blurb">The Physiotherapists at <strong>On the Go Physio</strong> have a wealth of
experience in working with people with Parkinson's disease, including being
the first service in New Zealand to offer the <a href="lsvt-big.html">LSVT
  BIG</a> programme.  We offer set programmes to help improve movement and mobility or can look 
specifically at whatever issues you may be having.</p>

<h3 id="early-stages-of-parkinsons">Early stages of Parkinson's</h3>

<p>The physical changes in Parkinson's disease (PD) happen slowly over time.
When you are first diagnosed you probably have one or two symptoms but are
still active. You may still be working full time or living an active
retirement. In these first years it is vital that you are actively working
towards maintaining your physical health and fitness and that any exercise
programme you are doing is geared specifically towards the problems you can
encounter with PD. <strong>On the Go Physio</strong> can design a programme with you and
check in with you as often or as little as you like. This is also an ideal time
to consider <a href="lsvt-big.html">LSVT
  BIG</a>.</p>

<h3 id="the-first-fall">The 'first fall'</h3>

<p>One of the 4 motor signs of PD is a change in balance although this does not
usually occur in the early stages. The first indicator is falling over or
losing your balance, usually when you are out and about. This ‘first fall' is
an important time to seek help. Without intervention that one fall can lead to
a loss in confidence and a gradual restriction in your activity. This in turn
lead to a slow deterioration in strength and further deterioration in balance
causing more falls or a very sheltered existence in which a person tends to
stay home where they feel safe. <strong>On the Go Physio</strong> can help you break
this cycle before it starts by offering you a thorough assessment of your
balance and an exercise and activity programme which focuses on your specific issues.</p>

<h3 id="freezing-of-the-gait">Freezing of gait – the mind is willing but the body stays still</h3>

<p>Freezing is a common experience later in the Parkinson's journey. This is
the experience of being 'stuck' when getting up from a chair, wanting to walk
but not being able to get started or walking along and having your feet
suddenly stop dead. This can lead to huge frustration and can also cause a
person to fall. <strong>On the Go Physio</strong> can offer a full assessment of your
movement difficulties and teach strategies to overcome freezing. The strategies
used will depend on each individual. Some people may benefit from the <a 
  href="cued-up.html">Cued Up! Exercise Programme</a></p>

<h3 id="short-shuffling-steps">Short shuffling steps</h3>

<p>Over time Parkinson's disease causes all movements to be smaller, including
the steps you take when walking.  <strong>On the Go Physio</strong> can put in place a
programme to help improve this.</p>

<h3 id="later-stages">Later stages</h3>

<p>If you have had Parkinson's for some time you may find you are depending
more and more on your family or spouse to provide you with physical assistance.
<strong>On the Go Physio</strong> can visit with your family and teach them the safest
ways to help you move, and some handy tips for coping at home.</p>



<h3 id="lsvt-big-programme"><a href="lsvt-big.html">LSVT BIG programme</a></h3>

<p><a href="lsvt-big.html">LSVT BIG</a> is a specialised program designed just for people with Parkinson's
disease and offered by <strong>On the Go Physio</strong> (the only team in Canterbury to offer
this). It is an intensive program with proven results which involves 16
sessions over 4 weeks.</p>
