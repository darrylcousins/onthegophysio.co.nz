<h3 id="falls-prevention">falls prevention</h3>

<img style="float:left" src="media/images/otg-bg-4.png" class="p-icon"/>
<p>
For the older adult falling, or being frightened of falling, can lead to a
marked restriction in activity and can have devastating effects on quality of
life. Poor strength and balance are a leading risk factor for falls and both of
these factors can be improved with Physiotherapy. After a thorough assessment
of your physical ability we can plan a program of activity and exercise to help
improve your strength and balance. Depending on your level of need we can then
leave you to do your exercise programme and check in as required or we can work
with you intensively for a few weeks if you need help and encouragement.</p>

<p>We can also do a thorough risk assessment of your home and advise on how to
make your environment safer.</p>

<h3 id="equipment-prescription">equipment prescription</h3>

<p><img src="media/images/otg-bg-4.png" class="p-icon"/>
If a walking stick or frame is needed to keep you safe
we can advise on the right one for you and link you in to a local supplier or
help you access one through the Ministry of Health if you meet their criteria.</p>

<p>We can also offer advice on purchase of wheelchairs and mobility scooters.</p>

<p>Rehabilitation following injury or illness Following illness or injury you
may need a period of rehabilitation to get you back to your usual level of
activity. We can work with you to determine what it is important for you to be
able to do and make a plan to get you there. Whether it is getting back to the
gardening, walking up the hills or just being able to move around the house we
can assist you.</p>

<p>If you have had an injury that is covered under ACC your Physiotherapy will
be cheaper although there is still a surcharge.</p>

<h3 id="residential-care">residential care</h3>

<p><img src="media/images/otg-bg-4.png" class="p-icon"/>
<span class="title">On the go Physio</span> is happy to provide their
services to people who live in hospital or residential care.  As you will have
nursing staff providing care it is our policy to work with them to ensure we
provide an appropriate service for you.</p>

<p>We also contract our service directly to residential care facilities
(including staff training in patient handling) and welcome enquires from
facility managers.</p>

<hr class="sep" />

<h3 id="carer-and-staff-training">carer and staff training</h3>

<p><img src="media/images/otg-bg-4.png" class="p-icon"/>
<span class="title">On the go Physio</span> offers patient handling training
to care staff and also to people who provide care to a loved one.</p>

<p>Often people become ‘informal carers’ providing physical assistance to a
loved one without any training. We can come into your home and give practical
training and advice on how to best assist the person you care for, including
advice on equipment that could help. We are able to bring in Occupational
Therapists to advise on specialised equipment and can recommend a number of
local suppliers. If specialised equipment is required it is likely you will be
eligible for free equipment through the Ministry of Health and we can help
facilitate this through a referral to the CDHB.</p>

<p>We are also available to speak to groups of carers and run practical
sessions tailored to the needs of the group. Some examples are: <ol style="margin-left: 150px;">
  <li>Assisting somebody up from the floor following a fall</li>
  <li>Helping somebody out of a chair</li>
  <li>Walking with somebody who is unsteady on their feet</li>
  </ol> </p>

<h3 id="rehabilitation-following-surgery">rehabilitation following surgery</h3>

<p><img src="media/images/otg-bg-4.png" class="p-icon"/>
Following surgery, whether planned or following a fracture, many of the main
muscles around a joint will weaken and walking and balance can be affected.
<span class="title">On the go Physio</span> can assess where you are at and
work with you to improve your walking, balance and overall function. If your
surgery was covered by private health insurance you will often be reimbursed
for any related Physiotherapy.</p>

<hr class="sep" />

<h3 id="physiotherapy-for-specific-conditions">physiotherapy for specific conditions</h3>

<p><img src="media/images/otg-bg-4.png" class="p-icon"/>
<span class="title">On the go Physio</span> specialises in working with people
with Parkinson’s disease, Multiple Sclerosis and other neurological conditions,
and following a stroke or head injury. These conditions are highly specialised
and the input needed with vary from person to person so please contact us to
discuss your specific requirements. We can work with you for a short burst of
therapy to work on improving one aspect or can be there with you in the long
term for regular input.</p>
