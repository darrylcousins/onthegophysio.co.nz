<h2>Falls prevention</h2>

<p class="blurb">
Falling (or fear of falling) can lead to loss of confidence and restriction of
daily activities for an older person.  Whether it is many falls, or just one
serious fall, it is essential to work actively to regain mobility and
confidence as soon as possible.  Evidence shows that greater confidence in
mobility is associated with fewer falls and better quality of life.  
</p>

<h3 id="what-causes-falls?">What causes falls?</h3>
<p>There are over 400 risk factors for falling including</p>
<ul>
<li>Having fallen before</li>
<li>Poor balance</li>
<li>Loss of strength</li>
<li>The wrong walking stick or frame</li>
<li>A risky environment e.g. poor lighting, loose rugs, poorly fitting shoes</li>
<li>Certain health conditions such as stroke, diabetes, arthritis, Parkinson's disease and many others</li>
<li>Taking more than 3 medications</li>
<li>Some specific medications</li>
<li>Bladder or bowel incontinence (even mild problems)</li>
<li>Poor vision</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-can-i-minimise-the-risk-of-falling?">How can I minimise the risk of falling?</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you have fallen before it is important to be assessed by physiotherapist experienced in falls prevention</li>
<li>Improve your balance through Tai Chi or have a physiotherapist design an individualised exercise programme for you</li>
<li>Improve your strength with regular physical activity such as walking and
gardening. If you are not able to get out and about <strong>On the Go
  Physio</strong> can design a programme for you to do at home</li>
<li>If you use a stick or walking frame it should have been measured for you by
a physiotherapist. <strong>On the Go Physio</strong> can
check this for you and make sure it still suits your needs</li>
<li>Ensure a safe home environment, you can download a <a class="pdf" 
  href="resources.html#keeping-your-home-safe" title="Download PDF Document">keeping your
home safe guide here</a> or arrange to have your home checked out by the
professionals at <strong>On the Go Physio</strong></li>
<li>Talk to your GP about your medications or any concerns you have regarding your risk of falls</li>
<li>Talk to your GP if you have any bowel or bladder incontinence</li>
<li>Have your vision checked each year</li>
<li>Consider having a personal alarm especially if you live alone</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-should-i-do-if-i-have-fallen">What should I do if I have fallen</h3>
<ul>
<li>It is good to have a plan in place in case of a fall. This can include
knowing the best way to get up off the ground if you are not injured.
<strong>On the Go Physio</strong> can teach you safe ways to get up with or
without help, a skill that should be practised regularly. If you are injured or
unable to get up then you need to activate your personal alarm or phone for an
ambulance. Just because you call an ambulance does not mean you will
necessarily have to go into hospital.</li>
<li>You should always let your GP know that you have had a fall, even if you weren't hurt.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="after-the-emergency-has-passed">After the emergency has passed</h3>
<ul>
<li>Consider why you fell, did you trip on something that can be fixed to
prevent it happening again? Did you try and get up to fast? If you fall
regularly it is worth recording them in a <a class="pdf" href="resources.html#falls-diary" 
 title="Falls Diary">falls diary</a> and showing
this to your physiotherapist or GP as there may be a pattern</li>

<li>If you have experienced an injury from the fall you may need input from a
physiotherapist to help get you back to normal. <strong>On the Go
  Physio</strong> is registered with ACC so if your injury is covered you
will not need to pay the full cost of the visit</li>

<li>If you feel shaken by the fall it is important that you try and get back to
your normal activities as quickly as possible to prevent a loss of confidence.
<strong>On the Go
  Physio</strong> can help with this.</li>

</ul>

<h4>Home safety assessment ($120*)</h4>

<p>A thorough look at your home and outdoor environment by a physiotherapist or
occupational therapist including a written report on changes you can make to
enhance your safety at home. This usually takes around one hour.</p>

<h4>A home and person safety assessment ($200*)</h4>

<p>A thorough look at your home and outdoor environment by a physiotherapist
including a written report on the changes you can make to enhance your safety
at home. An assessment of your strength, balance and current activity levels.
Written advice on what you can do to enhance your strength and balance and
decrease your falls risk. Includes a letter to your GP to inform them of the
outcome of the visit (if you agree to this). Usually takes up to two hours.</p>

<h4>Falls prevention package ($600*)</h4>

<p>This includes the home and person safety assessment and 6 follow up visits
to set up and carry out a progressive home exercise programme to improve your
strength and balance. This is ideal for people who have had falls in the past
and no longer venture beyond the front door or even out of their armchair! We
can work the visits in with your family or any existing carers. We stay in

Otago Exercise Programme to Prevent Falls in Older
Adults'</p>

<h4>Individual visits ($100 for first visit*)</h4>

<p>These are ideal for people who only need one or two visits for an assessment
andvice on decreasing your falls risk. This will usually involve teaching some
strength and balance exercises. We will work with you to plan how many visits
you will need and over what time frame.</p>

<p class="note">*each visit will incur a small travel surcharge if it is more than 5kms from the city centre.</p>
